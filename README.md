# Node Starter

This is my starter point for a NodeJS project. It doesn't include anything for the frontend development, as it is focused in Node. It includes basic directory structure, Express (with sessions, cookies and support for csrf) and EJS. It uses a config file with an object that lets you define local or production values, based in the third parameter of the node command.

To run, just npm install and then node app local |Â production
